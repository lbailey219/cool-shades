## Wear the Beats

With some wearables, it's fashion before function. That’s where it all began for us. We wanted to create a Wearable Device that you actually want to wear! Put them on. Walk around. Take a call or connect to your A.I. These wearable sunglasses offer the best of both worlds — convenience and connection — in a way that allows you to be present with your music as well as your surroundings. Wear the Beats in your life
